Next steps:
    Finish drafting out MainBattleClient's process_action_response() method
    Hammer out relationship between PlayerServer and Party

MVP:
    Each character can attack or rest, and parry or not parry
    Rest gives the character 1 SP, attacking costs 1 SP
    If the character is attacked while parrying, the attack is negated
    If the character is not attacked while parrying, the character misses their next turn
    If the character is not attacked while parrying, the character's parry is less effect the next turn
    When all of a player's characters run out of HP, that player loses

Extra features:
    Attacks have different types, and different characters are stronger or weaker when attacking with or being attacked
    by certain types of attacks
    Different attacks cost different amounts of SP
    Attacks can cost a certain number of AP, which determines how many attacks can be used per turn
    Characters can defend their allies in addition to themselves
    Some attacks can hit multiple characters
    Parties have a shared MP resource, which certain attacks can spend
